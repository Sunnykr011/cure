# 05 The Urge To Fix Everything 

Opening Reflection

We all know that restless feeling. A friend is down, the world seems cruel, and instinct pushes us into action. We want to find solutions, to mend, to soothe – anything to make the ache go away. In those moments, sitting still feels impossible; silence feels like surrender. There is a tenderness in this urge to fix, yet also a whisper of anxiety: What if we stop and the chaos swallows us? The voice inside whispers that if we don’t act, things will only get worse.

This impulse is familiar. It can arrive quietly, like a pulse beneath our skin telling us we must do something. It can arrive loudly, flooding our thoughts with to-do lists and plans. We see someone hurting, and suddenly our mind races with ways to set it right. In trying to repair what feels broken, we may gain a momentary sense of relief. But sometimes that relief is fleeting. The more we fix, the more we seek to control, the more restless we become.

What is this drive? And what happens when our hands are tied, or when the world refuses to bend? In this chapter, we turn our gaze inward, gently examining the urge to fix everything – the quiet compulsion to act, to solve, to make it all better, right now.

Definition

The urge to fix everything is the instinct that rises when we face pain or imperfection. It is the voice that tells us solutions must be found, problems must be solved, and feelings must be eased. This urge is not exactly conscious – it feels almost like a reflex. A knot of anxiety in your stomach becomes, in moments, a resolute plan of action. An uncomfortable silence becomes a barrage of advice. In essence, it is our refusal to simply be with what is, a restless energy that pushes us to change the scene.

It is important to see this urge without judgment. It often arises from a place of care. If a loved one is suffering, wanting to fix it can come from compassion. If a situation is painful, wanting to fix it can come from self-preservation. Yet, even noble intentions can carry a shadow: the shadow of not wanting to accept uncertainty or impermanence.

This tendency can feel like a kind of quiet mania: we try to reduce our discomfort by taking control. But control, it turns out, is often an illusion. The urge to fix might promise relief, but it sometimes settles nothing at all. Instead, it can keep us circling, always busy, always restless, afraid to simply sit with what is.

Origins

Our instinct to fix the world has deep roots. In the wild, action often meant survival. Think of our ancestors facing storm or predator: hesitation could be deadly. Over millennia, humans learned that scanning for danger and taking immediate action became a way to stay alive. This ancient wiring still pulses in our veins. When a problem looms, our mind switches on its survival mode, as if every problem were a roaring fire to extinguish or a predator to evade.

Children, too, learn this drive early. A small child might insist a parent dress a doll perfectly or fix a broken toy. In many ways, children believe the adult is there to make it all right. If things fall apart, the world can feel unsafe, and so the urge to set things right is like a craving for comfort or safety. These early experiences teach us a lesson: fixing things will make us okay. Over time, this becomes a default pattern of thought.

We carry these lessons forward. Somewhere in our biology and our childhood stories there is a promise: if I act, I can master the uncertainty around me. The psychologist’s phrase “illusion of control” hints at this root: we are wired to think that a quick action can stabilize our lives. The urge to fix everything comes, in part, from ancient instincts that say, “Do something, now, to survive.” Yet survival in a village of fire and spear is not the same as meaning in an age of smartphones and endless information. Our instincts are older than our problems.

Reflection Prompt: Recall a childhood memory when you or someone else hurried to fix a problem. How do you feel about it now?

Reflection Prompt: When did you last face a problem and feel the sudden impulse to solve it immediately? What drove that impulse?


Psychological Patterns

Modern psychology has many names for the pattern we all share: perfectionism, anxiety, compulsion, or even a distorted sense of responsibility. Underneath these labels lies a common thread: the belief that if we just do enough, we can make everything okay. This can surface as constant planning or as an inability to relax if tasks remain unfinished. We might label our own feelings “bad” unless we can change them.

The urge to fix often hides behind thoughts like, “I should know what to do,” or “Something must be done.” These thoughts can feel righteous – the good friend, the good worker, the good person should have an answer. But they also carry a price. We may end up listening less and advising more, trying to rearrange our own lives and the lives of others as if the world were a giant puzzle of which we hold all the pieces.

There can be subtle fears beneath the surface. A quiet terror of helplessness or chaos that we rarely speak aloud. We want to act because not acting feels like an admission of defeat, of uncertainty. Yet life will keep changing regardless. The stars fall, leaves wilt, seasons turn – none of these are exactly problems to solve. But sometimes we act as though they are.

Reflection Prompt: Notice your inner voice the next time something discomforting happens. What is it urging you to do?

Reflection Prompt: Can you remember a time when stepping back, rather than acting, changed how you felt about a situation?


Modern Manifestations

The urge to fix has found new playgrounds in our modern world. We live in a culture of answers – quick fixes and easy solutions whisper at us from billboards and screens. When a friend is upset, we may fire off a text, click on “helpful” advice articles, or push a self-help tool before giving space for emotion. Problems that once might have been lived through are now often treated like tasks waiting to be checked off.

Even our language reflects this mindset. We talk of “solving” complex social issues as if there were a neat solution in a single strategy. We track productivity, hoping to optimize every minute of life. Though we promised ourselves we would not rely on productivity jargon, still the feeling is there: that a life without solutions is a life half-lived.

In relationships, this urge plays out quietly. Perhaps a loved one expresses grief, and we immediately offer advice or cheer. The intent is kindness, but sometimes the message heard is that their grief is something to be fixed. Or at work, a problem arises and we feel restless until an answer appears, sometimes missing the value of pausing and truly understanding what happened.

The world can also confront us with issues so big they mock our small fixes. We might hear about injustices or suffering far away and feel paralyzed – or overshoot and throw ourselves into endless “action” out of a deep discomfort. We want to make things right now, but truthfully, we have limited power over much of life. Still, the urge is there.

Reflection Prompt: Think of a complex problem you care about (personal or global). What happens inside you when there isn’t a quick solution?

Reflection Prompt: In your daily life, when do you find yourself acting out of pressure rather than genuine choice? What does that tell you about what feels at stake?


Real-life Impacts

What happens when we try to fix everything? We can become exhausted. Our minds may be busy from dawn to dusk, solving one thing after another, as if calm only comes from the next problem fixed. But solving one problem often uncovers another, or merely reveals feelings we had not noticed. We can feel a creeping sense of failure: if there’s always something left unfixed, perhaps we were never enough.

In relationships, the cost can be subtle but real. A friend might withdraw if they sense they have to perform or explain themselves for us to offer solutions. A partner might feel unheard when our first move is to suggest a fix rather than to listen. Sometimes love becomes tangled with a to-do list. We may say gently, “I just want to help,” and in the same breath clip the wings of simple compassion.

For ourselves, the urge can mean a lack of presence. How many small moments slip by while we are plotting our next move? A child’s laugh, a quiet afternoon – seen only in the corner of our eye as we rush to “do something.” We might find that even in rest we struggle: we sit for a minute and then leap up, convinced we forgot something important.

And yet, the impulse to fix is not merely negative. It comes from caring, from refusing to accept needless suffering. But living only in action can blind us to what acceptance could bring. Acceptance does not mean resignation; it means understanding our limits. Sometimes a problem needs no immediate answer, only time or gentle attention.

Reflection Prompt: Reflect on a time when trying to solve a problem made it worse or more tangled. What happened to your feelings through that process?

Reflection Prompt: Have you ever noticed someone offering advice when all you needed was silence or a hug? How did it feel, and what did you learn from that?


Reflection Prompts

What feelings come up for you when you imagine doing nothing to solve a problem you care about?

When do you feel most at peace: when things are perfectly arranged, or sometimes when they are a bit messy?

Think of something in your life that you can’t change. What would it feel like to simply witness it without trying to alter it?

How might accepting uncertainty actually make space for a deeper kind of hope?

What does ‘fixing’ a problem give you – and what does it take away?


Forward Movement

Knowing this urge is part of being human, what can we do next? Perhaps the first step is simply noticing, without shame or blame. We might pause when the first impulse rises and gently ask ourselves, “What do I feel afraid of right now?” In that pause, there is a glimmer of choice. We may still decide to act – and that’s okay. Action has its time and place. But it can arise more from wisdom than from fear.

Sometimes forward movement means shifting from tackling to tending. Instead of leaping in to fix, we might practice listening or sitting with what is. Let a sorrow be heavy without an immediate remedy. Allow a frustration to exist without solving. In those spaces, something subtle can happen: understanding, and perhaps even a strange kind of healing, can begin on its own.

Imagine a river: if you try to dam it at every eddy, you grow tired and frustrated. But if you watch it, you learn its patterns. We, too, are like that river – flowing, restless, sometimes turbulent. We cannot stop our stream of thoughts and problems, but we can watch the current and know it is carrying us through.

In time, we may find that not every knot needs untangling by force. Some knots will loosen themselves. By tenderly caring for our own hearts – with patience and curiosity – we learn to live with what is, and in that acceptance, a different kind of action can emerge. One that feels calmer, wiser, and more in tune with life’s natural course.

Closing Thought

Life is woven with threads we can never fully straighten. The weight of this truth can feel heavy. Yet in that weight we find a kind of freedom, too – freedom to breathe, to be imperfect, to rest. Our urge to fix springs from the most human parts of us: love and fear bound together. As we learn to sit with these impulses, they may start to quiet.

We discover that some things we thought were problems to solve are simply parts of living that we are meant to experience. In the stillness beyond fixing, we may touch the gentle echo of meaning – not the loud roar of resolution, but the quiet certainty that we are here, growing through every storm. And in that quiet knowing, perhaps there is the truest cure of all.
